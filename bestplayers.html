    <h1>Best players</h1>
    <p>There are many great players in the history of Chelsea. There are too many to name all of them so I chose
    instead ot only pick what I think to be are the top five. Here is a list of the top five players to every play for Chelsea FC.</p>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Eden Hazard
            <ul>
                <li>The skills he uses on the field are above any player who has stepped on the pitch. He is a player who has always played well for Chelsea and still does. He combines
                skill and speed to tear defences apart. He is a Chelsea legend already.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fernando Torres
            <ul>
                <li> Known as 'El Nino' at his former club Athletico Madrid, he moved to Chelsea 
                after an impressive season with Liverpool. He did not score as many goals as we would
                have liked, but he is forever in my heart.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> John Terry
            <ul>
                <li>Captain of club and country for almost 20 years. He was a always a solid defender
                and leader for the blues.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
        </li>
        <li> Didier Drogba
            <ul>
                <li>One of the most prolific scorers of the premeire league and in the world. This man 
                is welcome back to Stamford Bridge anytime he would like.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
        </li>
        <li> John T. Cronin
            <ul>
                <li>Well this is actually me, and as I have never actually played for the Blues,
                I would still like to think of myself as a Chelsea legend.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
        </li>
        
    </ol>
